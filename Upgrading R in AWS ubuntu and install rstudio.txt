First, become root.

$ sudo /bin/bash
Remove the old version of R.

# apt-get remove r-base-core
Edit /etc/apt/sources.list and add the following:

add-apt-repository "deb http://cran.rstudio.com/bin/linux/ubuntu trusty/"
Back in the shell, add the public keys.

gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-key E084DAB9
gpg -a --export E084DAB9 | apt-key add -

# apt-get update
# apt-get upgrade
# apt-get install r-base

Update the package list and install the new base R package.

# apt-get update
# apt-get upgrade
# apt-get install r-base
When you launch R you should find that it is the sparkling new version.

Now you will want to update all of the packages too, so launch R (as root) and then do:

> update.packages(lib.loc = "/usr/local/lib/R/site-library"


If you have packages installed in a user library, you should update those too.
